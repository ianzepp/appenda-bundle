Note: Project was originally written in 2008/2009, saved in Google Code until the service was shut down, and then archived to Github.

## Description

Appenda is a collection of Object-Oriented PHP classes built along the Zend PHP namespace conventions, but using a dependency-injection development style modeled after the Spring Framework (from Java). In particular, the bean container in Appenda is designed to be significantly compliant with the Spring Bean definition schema.

Appenda provides both a core package, and several sample service bundles. Appenda also integrates with both Maven and Zend to leverage the beauty of Maven dependency management.
